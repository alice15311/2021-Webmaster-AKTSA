      <p id = "mission">We believe that everybody deserves a second chance to turn their life around. Our company offers former drug addicts a way to receive alternative medications for their ailments in order to redirect the prescripton misuse cycle and permanently keep former drug addicts from using again.</p>
      <img src = "media/coffee_meeting.jpg" alt = "People sitting around the table in a meeting" class = "float-right"/>
      <p>It's why we're dedicated to creating alternative medicines that doesn't contain addictive substances and drugs. With the current pandemic, many former addicts are refusing treatments for their ongoing illnesses due to the fear of relapsing. In addition, many physicians are faced with tough decisions in trying to prescribe pain medications due to the inadequate pain relief caused by the limited opiod exposure as well as the fear of indirectly causing a new relapse.</p>
      <p>With the complete removal of opiods and addictive substances from our medication, we are offering a life-changing and efficient alternative to both addicts and their physicians. With this in mind, we mandate that each purchase from our company shall be accompanied by a physician's note.</p>

          <p class = "timeTitle">Handling a Pandemic</p>
          <p class = "year">February 2020</p>
          <p>The global COVID-19 pandemic took hold this year, but we're proud to say we rose to the challenge. We expanded our delivery networks, hired more qualified counselors, offered more and more alternative medications in our store, and last but not certainly not least, added the option for group therapy on our platform! It was a tough year for everyone, but we tried to make it the best we could for our customers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "timepoint">
          <p class = "timeTitle">Therapy Launch</p>
          <p class = "year">August 2019</p>
          <p>Only about a year after our successful launch of our store, we introduced our next big leap - a platform on which we could help addicts in other ways, namely through therapy. We were excited to see in what other ways we could help improve the quality of others' lives!</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "timepoint">
          <p class = "timeTitle">Official Launch</p>
          <p class = "year">October 2018</p>
          <p>KatKure was officially launched and ready for customers! Through a whole year of patient development and testing , we were proud to finally deliver our quality product straight to people's doors!</p>
        </div>
        <div class = "timepoint">
          <p class = "timeTitle">The Beginning</p>
          <p class = "year">March 2017</p>
          <p>The month where KatKure all started. It wasn't a sudden lightning strike of inspiration, but rather the realization of a vision that our founders had always had. It was a what-if possibiliy that suddenly could be done--and that is where our journey began.</p>
