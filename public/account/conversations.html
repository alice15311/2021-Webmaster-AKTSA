        <!--FORMAT, IMPORTANT!
          ALL messages will have the "message" class. If you want to have a quick reply (without the little carrot on the side), make the class "message quickly-after"
          ALWAYS set data-chat-from to either "you" or "other" depending on who the message is from

          Example:
          <div class = "message" data-chat-from = "you">
            <img src = ""/> Image here, only add image if it's not a quick reply
            
            <div class = "chat-text">
              Add text here using <p> tags
            </div>
          </div>

          If you are doing stuff for the group chat and the message is from another person, add the name of the person it's from to the div like this:
          <div class = "message" data-chat-from = "other" data-person = "Luke">...</div>
          This will create a message div with the name "Luke" underneath it. Again, this is only necessary for the group chat (the second conversation)

          If you want to create a time divider, add 
          <div class = "time-divider">
            <span>Month Day 2021</span>
          </div>
        -->
