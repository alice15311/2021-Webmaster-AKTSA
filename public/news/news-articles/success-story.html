        <h1>Success Story</h1>
        <p>Mary Dutt, 11/21/20</p>
        <p>To further express our passion and immense care for our business format, this is the story of how we realized the problem and created an effective platform
          to materialize it.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class = "content news-page">
      <p>What makes us so different from the others?</p>
      <p>We identified a growing problem and put our heads together to not only solve it, but to also do it in a way that makes the customer feel at ease.</p>
      
      <h2>The Flashing Lightbulb</h2>
      <p>Many of us know the negative and long-term effects of addiction. In most cases, former addicts still suffer from their addiction. This has been exemplified during
       the COVID-19 pandemic. Addiction is a complex challenge to overtake, with relapses and recovery - this is exactly why KatKure was created.</p>
      
      <p>With COVID-19 came many unexpected issues and stressors that could lead to relapses in substance abuse. Unemployment rates have gone, which basically sets off
      a chain reaction of other stressors. However, to combat addiction, research in alternative therapies is growing and becoming a widely used technique.</p>
      
      <p>This was the moment we knew that this was the golden ticket. We first targeted how we were going to receive all the various natural medicines. We hired the safest
       and best manufacturers in the US, and we took this decision with great care. We want to provide the best services to our customers, and worrying if the medicine is 
      safe or not would simply add another stressor. To verify that all our products are safe and effective, we go through a meticulous inspection and only give out the best
       of the best.</p>
      
      <h2>Our Unique Strategy</h2>
      
      <p>Lockdowns. Quarantine. Masks. These are all restrictions that are being actively placed on us, but there is no out to it. Walking into a physical pharmacy now has added worries and many patients fear simply getting what they need. KatKure as a whole decided to eliminate any wavering fears and put our platform on a system that brings our customers at ease and provided the best quality resource- an online pharmacy with no addictive substances.</p>
      
      <p>You may wonder how we ensure that our products are always available. We analyze US trends, world-wide trends and local trends to accurately calculate which products are more popular and have a higher demand. Our complex, yet accurate, algorithms accompanied with a collaboration with Dogsy Research Corp., allows us to fulfill your needs productively.</p>
      
      <p>Our mission is to build a better world for everyone, no matter the circumstance. We understand the challenge of overcoming addiction, and we will do everything we can
       to make it the easiest it can be for you.</p>
      
      <p>Sincerely, <br> KatKure</p>
