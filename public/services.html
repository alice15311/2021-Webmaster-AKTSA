                <p data-aos = "fade-left">Talking and listening to others discussing their own struggles can help you figure out strategies that you can apply to your own life. You can get ideas and advice from other members, realize that you're not alone, and develop a lifelong support network along the way.</p>
                <p data-aos = "fade-left">On our platform, you can find a wide array of groups ranging from 5 to 15 people in size, all led by one of our trusted professional counselors. You can easily match with potential groups with our convenient search function that filters based on criteria like when and how long they meet for, as well as group size. </p>
                <p data-aos = "fade-left">But if group counseling isn't for you, that's okay! With KatKure, you can choose to attend only individual counseling, or only group sessions, or both. We've always believed that we should be here to support you however we can.</p>
