            <p>You can find more details about both on this FAQ page, and also by checking out our pages about our services <a href = "services.html">here</a> and exploring the products we offer in our shop <a href = "products.html">here</a>.</p>

            <p>For the shop, no account is needed! Simply browse our products for medication that you need - such as those that relieve headaches - and add them to your cart. You'll be able to upload your prescriptions on paper or use your doctor's e-prescription in order to verify your purchases, and then checkout and wait for delivery!</p>

          <div class = "faq-content">
            <p>Pricing varies depending on your counselor and what you need. No person is ever the same, and we understand that - our plans are meant to be as flexible as possible while giving you the care you need.</p>
            <p>Baseline prices are listed under our pricing plans, and in the majority of cases will not be subject to change.</p>
            <p>Additional fees may be added on depending on the level of availability your counselor will expect to maintain and the number of meetings you feel you need during a month. Extra meetings not included in the general plan may also add to the total depending on your counselor.</p>

          <div class = "faq-content">
            <p>First, create an account here on our platform and log in. You should be prompted to answer a few quick questions about you in order to let us know you better.</p>
            <p>After you've finished those questions, we will process your request and try and find a match for you based on your responses. You'll be able to see which counselors we've recommended for you in your account dashboard here on KatKure after a few hours.</p>
            <p>You can then review the counselor matches, see their profiles, and send requests to ones you would like to meet before choosing which counselor you will be with. If you already had a counselor in mind, you can search them up in your dashboard and also send them a request.</p>
