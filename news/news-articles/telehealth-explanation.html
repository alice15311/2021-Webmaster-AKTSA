        <h1>Telehealth: an Explanation</h1>
        <p>Catherine Pan, 7/15/20</p>
        <p>You probably have heard the word telehealth used before, perhaps even on this webpage. It's a term that's becoming more and more common to refer to how technology is transforming the medical field, but what exactly is it?</p>
      </div>
    </div>

      <!--intro-->
      <p>Telehealth, like many things, has varying definitions as to what exactly it refers to. Depending on the organization or usage, it might refer to the transfer of electronic information from one site to another, or more simply mean remote healthcare, or encompass the general use of technology and electronic information in health care, health education, and health and medical administrations.</p>
      <p>Examples of telehealth in action might include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Videoconferencing between patients and doctors</li>
        <li>Remotely prescribed treatments or medications</li>
        <li>Controlling and monitoring treatment or vital signs from a distance</li>
        <li>Having patient portals</li>
        <li>Transmitting images of patient scans electronically</li>
        <li>And much more!</li>
      </ul>

      <!--differences-->
      <h2>Telehealth vs. Telemedicine?</h2>
      <p>Telehealth and telemedicine may seem the same at first, are sometimes used interchangeably. But other times they are used with an understanding of a slight distinction between the terms.</p>
      <p>Among the recognitions of their differences, telehealth tends to be the all-encompassing, more general term, whereas telemedicine is more specific. Telemedicine, in other words, is a smaller part of telehealth that is covered when telehealth is generally referred to.</p>
      <p>A specific definition of telemedicine would be the delivery of clinical care by physicians remotely, through the use of electronic communication and other technologies. Examples would include remote diagnoses of conditions and virtual meetings between the patient and the physician. Telehealth, however, could also refer to non-clinical care, or care provided by all health professionals (nurses, pharmacists, etc.) and not only by physicians.</p>
      <p>While we're defining confusingly similar terms, why not throw another one into the mix? Telecare is a term that, again, sounds like it should mean the same thing as the first two. Distinctions, as always, can be made.</p>
      <p>Like telemedicine, telecare is generally recognized to be a subsection of telehealth. It refers to the remote care of a patient who is in their own home, through technologies like medical alert systems, mobile monitoring devices, and of course, the all-powerful devices of the computer, tablet, or phone.</p>
      <p>So in a quick recap:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Telehealth</b>: the broad, general term for services delivered by health professionals using technology</li>
        <li><b>Telemedicine</b>: a specific term referring to clinical, remote care by physicians</li>
        <li><b>Telecare</b>: a specific term referring to the remote monitoring of a patient in their own home</li>
      </ul>

      <!--benefits-->
      <h2>The benefits of telehealth</h2>
      <p>Due to improved technology and more affordable access to them, telehealth can really be a powerful tool that aids the medical system.</p>
      <p>Its major benefits, of course, lie in its remote nature. People who otherwise might've had little access to medical care--especially those in rural communities, where the local clinic might be miles away, and more specialized care might be even further--are able to receive quality care with virtual communications.</p>
      <p>Remote care is also much more convenient--no longer do people have to take the time to drive or travel to their doctor's office for an appointment, but they can sit down anywhere with their computer or other device with a virtual appointment. Transportation times and waiting rooms are eliminated from the process, which makes it easier for people to fit visits into their schedule.</p>
      <p>Telhealth also is cost-effective by cutting down on the frequency of travel. Remote consultations remove the need to transport the patient to and from physical locations to different specialists or to more qualified health professionals. This not only gets rid of some of the financial troubles that might result from this, but also the operational difficulties that could occur.</p>
      <p>Overall, telehealth offers a great opportunity to get timely, effective care when you most need it in a cost-efficient way, and it has great potential to help us address the challenges our health system faces in the future.</p>
