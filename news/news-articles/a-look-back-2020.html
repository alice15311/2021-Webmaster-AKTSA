        <h1>A Look Back on 2020</h1>
        <p>Aditi Koratpallikar, 1/24/2021</p>
        <p>To say 2020 was a rough year would be a massive understatement. Read more to see how KatKure is providing a positive outlet. </p>

    <div class = "content news-page">
      <p>Retrospecting back to 2020, many people throughout the world most likely asked the same question: what hasnâ€™t happened in 2020? This question leads to some interesting answers, with the aid of some re-engineering. </p>
      <p>For starters, we had the once-in-a-lifetime pandemic, murder hornets, political turmoil, bushfires, several untimely deaths, and many more tragic events. However, it's important to remember that there is a light at the end of the tunnel, and KatKure is on its way to provide it to many people.</p>
      <h2>How did the Pandemic affect former addicts?</h2>
      <p>According to EHS Today, before the global pandemic, many former drug addicts have been attending group therapy sessions and taking their medications monitored by their physicians. However, with the pandemic, many drug addicts were not able to attend therapy and receive help for their mental health, a growing concern during 2020. </p>
      <p>Coupled with the subliminal fears of being laid off and not being able to pay rent, substance and alcohol abuse has skyrocketed. Many people are relapsing and using opiates and other addictive substances as a coping method to the current situation. From March to May alone, there was a 32% increase in non-medicated fentanyl and an overall 18% increase in drug overdoses.</p>
      <h2>How can KatKure help?</h2>
      <p>KatKure has a solution to this pressing predicament. With our revolutionary therapeutic techniques and innovative medications, we can combat this ravaging disease and help the lives of many people. </p>
      <p>Here at KatKure, we are keeping in mind that the pandemic impacts many people in various ways. With the added pressures of global unstability, we aim to create any alleviation we can to the general public. We are able to do this in two main ways: Therapy and Alternative Medicines.</p>
      <p>With our certified therapists and psychologists, we are proud to offer single or group virtual counseling sessions to our consumers. These therapy sessions are much more than ways to control relapses. Therapy is used to help the mental health of each and every one of our consumers, especially due to the fact that it is extremely hard to go to in-person therapy.</p>
      <p>We realize that the pandemic affects not only our physical health, but also our mental health. It is important we take good care of both. In addition to our therapy, we are also offering alternative medicines which do not contain addictive substances such as opiates and fentanyl for chronic pain and other illnesses. We are using this in order to limit any chances of potential overdoses and not create any future chances of a relapse.</p>
      <p>We're in this together. KatKure believes in you.</p>
