        <h1>Success Story</h1>
        <p>To further express our passion and immense care for our business format, this is the story of how we realized the problem and created an effective platform
          to materialize it.</p>

      <p>What makes us so different from the others?</p>
      <p>We identified a growing problem and put our heads together to not only solve it, but to also do it in a way that makes the customer feel at ease.</p>
      
      <h2>The Flashing Lightbulb</h2>
      <p>Many of us know the negative and long-term effects of addiction. In most cases, former addicts still suffer from their addiction. This has been exemplified during
       the COVID-19 pandemic. Addiction is a complex challenge to ovetake, with relapses and recovery- this is why KatKure was created.</p>
      
      <p>With COVID-19 came manyunexpected issues and stressors that could lead to relapses in substance abuse. Unemployment rates have gone, which basically sets off
      a chain reaction of other stressors. However, to combat addiction, research in homeopathic therapies is growing and becoming a widely used technique.</p>
      
      <p>This was the moment we knew that this was the golden ticket. We first targeted how we were going to receive all the various natural medicines. We hire the safest
       and best manufacturers in the U.S, and we hae carefully taken this decision. We want to provide the best services to our customers, and worrying if the medicine is 
      safe or not would simply add another stressor. To verify that all our products are safe and effective, we go through a meticulous inspection and only give out the best
       of the best.</p>
      
      <h2>Construction and Execution</h2>
      
      <p>Lockdowns. Quarantine. Masks. These are all restrictions that are being actively placed on us, but there is no out to it. Walking into a physical pharamcy now 
      has added worries and many patients fear simply getting what they need. KatKure as a whole decided to elminate any wavering fears and put our platform on a system
      that brings our customers at ease and provided the best quality resource- an online homeopathic pharamcy.</p>
