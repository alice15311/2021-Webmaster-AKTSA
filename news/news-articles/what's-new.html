        <h1>What's New</h1>
        <p>Allison Vicera, 1/7/21</p>
        <p>2021 is a new year and the team at KatKure is eager to jump right in! Read below about how we are making strides to expand and provide more support for you this coming year. </p>

    <div class = "content news-page">
      <p>With the coming new year, the team here at KatKure has decided to ramp up their goals! We have lots of new features and processes to help make you and your journey a better one. Below is a list of recently released and upcoming projects or fixes to certain aspects of the company. Further details will come out later. </p>
      <h2>Stock and Orders</h2>
      <p>We have recently redone our supply chain! With our new partners for this year we can get you your medicine faster than before. Better restocking and prices to come.</p>
      <p>Previously, many of the products were made to order and supplied slowly due to this. For the first time since our conception, we have created a more affordable and supportable supply system to help supply the many more customers we have received. </p>
      <p>Although we have changed the supply chain, there will still be a lack of stock due to lower manufacturing and availability during these times. The pandemic has hit our suppliers hard and we will continue to experience a shortage. We appreciate your support and understanding during these hard times. For all those in a subscription based plan, this should not impact you and your supply. </p>
      <h2>Virtual Therapy</h2>
      <p>Oftentimes the journey towards being clean is a long and arduous one, you need support and professionals to help give you this support. Therapists specialized in drug rehabilitation often arenâ€™t widely available near by or suitable for your schedule. For this, we propose a high quality therapy service you can access from anywhere. </p>
      <p>With our many highly qualified therapists and specialists, we provide you a personalized and expert service suitable to help support you during your journey. This feature has been in development for a while, and we are excited to announce it! More details will be available within the coming months, check back often to hear more!</p>
      <h2>Our Team</h2>
      <p>More customers mean more activity and actions for our team to support. We are excited to announce a new chief marketing executive and development of relations support position! Although not currently finalized, we will be welcoming two more members to our team so keep a look out for that! There are still positions open for hire at this moment in time. Contact us for more details!</p>
